<h1>To-Do List</h1>

I created a Fully Functional and Responsive To-Do Tasks List.
   - Languages used : HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.
   - User can add task with description and can give priority to task.
   - Tasks get listed in Second Section with their Priority Color.
   - User can Edit or Delete thier Tasks.
   - User can checkmark their tasks.
   - Users can also change theme of application whatever they like.
   - We can filter down the tasks according to Priority.
   - This app stores data in LocalStorage, so no need to worry if you lost your connection or close tab. Whenever you open it, it will list down all tasks whatever last               time you updated in it.
