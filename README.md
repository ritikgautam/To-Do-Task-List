<h1>To-Do List</h1>

I created a Fully Functional and Responsive To-Do Tasks List.

   - Languages used : HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.
   - User can add task with description and can give priority to task.
   - Tasks get listed in Second Section with their Priority Color.
   - User can Edit or Delete thier Task. Also can checkmark their task.
